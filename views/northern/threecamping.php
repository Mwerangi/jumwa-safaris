                  After breakfast we descend 600m into this magnificent crater for a morning, half-day game drive. The Ngorongoro Crater is one of the most densely crowded African wildlife areas in the world and is home to an estimated 30,000 
                  animals including some of Tanzania’s last remaining black rhino. Supported by a year round water supply and fodder, the Ngorongoro Crater supports a vast variety of animals, which include herds of wildebeest, zebra, buffalo, 
                  eland, warthog, hippo, and giant African elephants. Another big draw card to this picturesque national park is it’s dense population of predators, which include lions, hyenas, jackals, cheetahs and the ever-elusive leopard, 
                  which sometimes requires a trained eye to spot. We will enjoy a picnic lunch in the crater, after which we travel to the Tarangire National Park. Dinner and overnight at Campsite   Full board included

                  After breakfast do we head into the Tarangire National Park for a morning game drive. The park runs along the line of the Tarangire River and is mainly made up of low-lying hills on the Great Rift Valley floor. 
                  Its natural vegetation mainly consists of Acacia woodland and giant African Baobab trees, with huge swamp areas in the south. Both the river and the swamps act like a magnet for wild animals, during Tanzania’s dry season. 
                  The Tarangire National Park is reputed to contain some of the largest elephant herds in Africa. This African national park is also home to three rare species of animals – the Greater Kudu, the Fringed-eared Oryx, as well as 
                  a few Ashy Starlings. We return to the lodge for lunch after which we will depart for Arusha town and we will end our African safari adventure.
