        <p>
          Tanzania is known for its various authentic cultures. Starting from the humbleness, respect, and 
          loving nature of its people towards visitors and tourists, and extending to the social norms of various tribes in the country. 
          We have a diversity of tribes such as the famous Maasai who are known for their unique dancing and dressing style that fascinate many people from different parts of the world.

              <p>Three Days Gombe Chimpanzees Trekking is a beautiful and unique adventure as it is among the few places in the world where chimpanzees can be seen in their natural habitat. Up to this time there are no roads established
                 to Gombe National Park so visitors can only reach the park by boat. Among the attractions for Gombe Stream National Park are the Chimpanzees, beautiful landscapes, and the Kakombe waterfalls. Each day you will trek
                  into the forest to observe these animated primates at play.</p>
