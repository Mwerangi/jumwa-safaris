                    After breakfast, you will begin your journey to the Maasai Mara Game Reserve. The Maasai Mara is Kenya’s most popular game reserve and one of the top reserves in all of Africa, and for good reason. In the “Mara” as we locals call it, you will most likely see the “Big Five”, the lion, leopard, rhino, buffalo and more elephants. There is a remarkable amount of 
                    wildlife including a wide variety of gazelles, an abundance of zebras and countless wildebeests. There are 450 species of birds as well. It is for good reason that the film “Out of Africa” took place in the Mara
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the summer season, the park is home to the Great Migration. During the Migration, lit-erally millions of wildebeests, zebras, and the gazelles from the Serengeti plains cross en masse across the Kenyan-Tanzanian border and jump across the Mara River in search of grazing lands. People come from all corners of the world to see this awe-inspiring and overwhelming spectacle of nature.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether or not you arrive during the Great Migration, the park in a wonderland and you will not be disappointed. For our first day in the Mara you will arrive in time for lunch, followed by an afternoon game drive.
                    Return for dinner and overnight at your lodge.

                    These two days you will spend inside this magnificent reserve. You will have two full-day game drives. Leaving in the early greatly increases our chances of seeing lots of animal species as the cooler morning hours are when the animals like to emerge from hidden foliage.

                    <span class="stong"> NB: </span> if you are interested in an areal view, a balloon ride gives you a bird’s eye view and a rush of adrenaline as you float over this massive park. This is an early bird activity as it goes from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. After your exhilarating ride you will have 
                    your delicious bush breakfast and con-tinue on your game drive.
