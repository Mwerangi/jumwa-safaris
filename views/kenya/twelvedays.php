        <p>With upto 390 species of mammals in Kenya and over 1100 bird species, Kenya has a rich diversity of wildlife and while out on Safari in one of the many national parks or reserves, it is expected that you would spot not only the 'Big Five' 
            as often mentioned widely, but also infact the 'Big Nine', to include the Lion, Elephant, Leopard, Buffalo, Rhino, Girrafe, Zebra, Cheetah and Hippo if in one of the parks which has all these animals.</p>

                    After a sumptuous breakfast, you will be transferred to Wilson airport. Fly to Samburu Game Reserve the best place to find several endemic Northern species, including Gerenuk, the Reticulated Giraffe, Somali Ostrich and Grevy’s Zebra. You will be greeted at the airstrip by the local and very knowledgeable guides and driven to Saruni Samburu with a game viewing drive en route
                </p>
                <p>Your home for the next two days, Samburu Saruni is perched atop the hills with fabulous & spectacular views overlooking the 240,000 acre Kalama Community Conservancy. Activities during your stay here include game drives inside the Samburu National Reserve and Buffalo Springs National Reserve, however many of the activities take place in Kalama, a 
                    true gem in northern Kenya. Night game drives in the Kalama Conservancy as well as visits to the caves where in the past the Samburu have painted and carved rock art are also available. Game walks accompanied by expert guides are another highlight as well as bush dinners and star gazing.
                </p>
                <p>The reserve harbours a number of wildlife species rarely found elsewhere in any numbers, such as Grevy's zebra, the reticulated giraffe and the Beisa Oryx. Samburu's permanent water supply is a magnet for numerous animal species that include the big cats, herbivores and reptiles such as crocodiles. The long-necked gerenuk, elephants, cheetah, buffalos, Grant's gazelle, 
                    dikdiks and waterbuck are some of the animals most commonly found searching for succulence among the reserve's withered scrubs </p>

                    After a leisurely al fresco breakfast, you will be transferred to the airstrip where you now fly to the extraordinary destination of the Maasai Mara. Scenically, it epitomises the Africa of childhood imaginings: the lone Acacia tree against the cobalt sky, rolling plains that positively heave with life, the sluggish curves of the Mara River choc-a-bloc with hippo and crocs and the odd red "shuka" 
                    of a Maasai herdsman who carry on their normal pace of life, largely oblivious of all the commotion around them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon arrival at the airstrip your Kicheche guide will be there to welcome you and drive you to the camp - Kicheche Valley camp OR Kicheche Bush camp - whilst enjoying a short game drive en route. At the camp you will have some time for leisure, lunch and afternoon tea. Then you will set off for your afternoon game drive followed by evening sundowner drinks overlooking the plains… arrive back in 
                    camp in time for showers and drinks around the camp fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A typical day at the Magical Kicheche starts early as tea or coffee is brought to your tent. Enjoy a full breakfast at camp before setting off on a full day game drive to the reserve or another conservancy. You will see differing terrain along with plenty of animal and bird species on your extended game drive. Take a break in one of the many scenic viewpoints where your picnic lunch will be set out. 
                    After your break continue game driving until you arrive back at camp late in the afternoon. Wind down at camp after an exhilarating day in the field and gather at the campfire for an aperitif before dinner is served later in the evening.

                    Set on the outskirts of Arusha on Tanzania's largest coffee plantation, Arusha Coffee Lodge is the ideal stopover on a Tanzanian safari. Retaining its luxurious colonial atmosphere, the lodge has wonderful views of the towering Mount Meru and is well-placed to access Tanzania's famous safari destinations. Overnight: Arusha

                <p>
                    Ngorongoro Crater is the largest unbroken caldera in the world. The cone is believed to have collapsed nearly two million years ago, and while the cone was standing, it could have been as tall, if not taller, than Mt. Kilimanjaro. The crater (1,800 feet deep and 102 square miles) is a microcosm of East African scenery with abundant wildlife – 
                    more than 25,000 larger animals, mostly zebra and wildebeest. This is also the best place in Tanzania to see magnificent black-maned lion and black rhino. A soda lake changes size depending on the rains that are the lifeline of this amazing land.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Colorful flamingoes and more than 100 species of birds found here and not in the Serengeti, frequent the area. Patience may also reward you with glimpses of leopard, cheetah, hyena, jackal, elephant, warthog, buffalo, impala, buffalo, hartebeest, eland and lots of other antelopes. As you descend into the crater, you may see the local Maasai 
                    as they take their cattle down the steep walls of the crater.

                    Serengeti National Park (3,646,500 acres) is the jewel in the crown of Tanzania’s protected areas with over three million large mammals roaming its plains. The Serengeti has come to symbolize paradise to all, including the local Maasai, who have grazed their cattle on the vast grassy plains for generations. To the Maasai, it is Siringitu – "the place where the land goes on forever." 
                    Today, the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, and the Maasai Mara Game Reserve across the border in Kenya, protect the greatest and most varied collection of terrestrial wildlife on earth, and one of the last great migratory systems still intact.
