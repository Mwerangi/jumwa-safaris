        <h2>Western Circuit Tourism</h2>
        <p>
        Western safari circuit is where you get to explore the intriguing jungles of Tanzania to meet chimpanzees. But, it’s not all about the primates. Here, you can also find rare 
        roan and sable antelope species as well as hippos, giraffes and if you’re lucky, you can spot elephants, leopards, zebras and maybe even a lion, too!
        </p>
        <p>
        Western safari circuit comprises of Mahale Mountains National Park, Katavi National Park, and Gombe Stream National Park. Although not the primary reason for visiting Tanzania, 
        the western circuit promises a different kind of adventure and an exciting side trip to any wildlife safari. Since this area is very remote, the only way to get here is via light aircraft or boat. 
        Flights may start from Arusha, Dar es Salaam or even Zanzibar.

              <p>Three Days Gombe Chimpanzees Trekking is a beautiful and unique adventure as it is among the few places in the world where chimpanzees can be seen in their natural habitat. Up to this time there are no roads established
                 to Gombe National Park so visitors can only reach the park by boat. Among the attractions for Gombe Stream National Park are the Chimpanzees, beautiful landscapes, and the Kakombe waterfalls. Each day you will trek
                  into the forest to observe these animated primates at play.</p>
